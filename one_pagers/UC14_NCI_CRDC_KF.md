## UC14. Genome-wide Sequencing Analysis to Identify the Genes Responsible for Enchondromatoses and Related Malignant Tumors

**Title:** Genome-wide Sequencing Analysis to Identify the Genes Responsible for Enchondromatoses and Related Malignant Tumors

**Platforms involved:** Kids First Data Resource Center, Cancer Research Data Commons

**Scientific question/use case:** 

A subset of isolated gliomas and chondrosarcomas is caused by pathogenic variants in genes related to the HIF-1 pathway. Based on our preliminary analysis of WES data from patients with OD (Ollier Disease) or MS (Maffucci Syndrome), we expect that some of these genes such as EGLN1, KDM4C, VHL, CDKN2A, and HIF1A in the HIF-1 pathway will contain causative variants responsible for increased risk for subset of gliomas and chondrosarcomas in patients with OD or MS.

Gliomas are characterized by significant germline and somatic genetic heterogeneity. CDKN2A, IDH1 and IDH2 are among the genes identified as responsible for specific types of gliomas. Homozygous deletion in CDKN2A is detectable in approximately 50% of gliomas. Furthermore, CDKN2A germline variants are responsible for the melanoma-astrocytoma syndrome, and genetic variants close to both CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes (on the chromosomal locus 9p21) are known to increase the risk for glioma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. CDKN2A encodes the protein p14ARF, a tumor suppressor that sequesters HIF-1 in the nucleolus and inhibits HIF-1 mediated transcription. Somatic heterozygous GoF variants in IDH1 and IDH2 have been identified in gliomas and are typically associated with additional genetic variation that define the specific glioma type. GoF IDH1 and IDH2 variants confer a new function—the aberrant enzymes produce the oncometabolite D-2HG from alpha-ketoglutarate. Koivunen et al. (2012) suggested that D-2HG activates EGLN, downregulating HIF1A and contributing to pathogenesis of IDH mutant gliomas. Based on the literature and our own findings, we hypothesize that pathogenic variants in other genes related to HIF-1 pathway identified in patients with OD and MS cause isolated forms of gliomas and chondrosarcomas in a subset of patients.

**Interoperability/technical plan:** 

We will access tumor (and corresponding non-tumor tissue) WGS data from 829 patients from the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas and investigate these data for variants in HIF-1 related genes including our preliminary HIF-1 related candidate genes. Data will be accessed through the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program Data Resource Center and CAVATICA. We will also investigate variants in HIF-1 related genes in tumor and (and corresponding non-tumor tissue) WGS data from 1,348 patients with gliomas (sequenced as part of 8 projects - FM-AD, GENIE-DFCI, GENIE-GRCC, GENIE-JHU, GENIE-MDA, GENIE-MSK, GENIE-VICC, and TCGA-LGG) and from 878 patients with chondrosarcoma (sequenced as part of 8 projects - GENIE-DFCI, GENIE-GRCC, GENIE-JHU, GENIE-MDA, GENIE-MSK, GENIE-UHN, GENIE-VICC, and TARGET-OS) and available through the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Research Data Commons (NCI CRDC).

With the analysis of these datasets, we expect to identify somatic candidate causative variants in HIF-1 related genes in a subset of isolated gliomas and chondrosarcoma.
