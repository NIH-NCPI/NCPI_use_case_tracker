## UC14. Using the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons and NHLBI BioData Catalyst to better understand precision medicine

**Title:** Using the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons and NHLBI BioData Catalyst to better understand precision medicine

**Platforms involved:** Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), BioData Catalyst (BDC)

**Scientific question/use case:** 

Precision medicine is expected to leverage genetic and other data modalities in order to gain insights that will lead to more personalized and effective diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of disease.  Collectively, cancer and disorders of the heart, lung, and blood represent some of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States and the rest of the world.  This study focuses on integrating and understanding the landscape of clinically-relevant genomic findings in a large population of patients available from both the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

**Interoperability/technical plan:** 

Patient clinical and genomic data will be requested (via dbGaP), accessed, and integrated from 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database in the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons, and 2) the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) database from the NHLBI BioData Catalyst (BDC).  We will build an informatics pipeline to compare and contrast the landscape of clinically-relevant genomic findings from these datasets.  In particular, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) has currently identified 59 genes with clinical relevance – specific applications include cancer and cardiovascular diseases – for which incidental findings should be reported to patients.[1]  This collection of genes (“ACMG59”) will provide the starting point for integrating the populations, searching across relevant subsets, and performing additional scientific or technical analyses.
