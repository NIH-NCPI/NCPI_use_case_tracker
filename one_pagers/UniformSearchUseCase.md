## Uniform search of sample and sequence read information across NCBI and Kids First Repositories

**Title:** Uniform search of sample and sequence read information across NCBI and Kids First Repositories

**Scientific Question/Use Case:**  A researcher/user has a question, a general phenotype or a question of interest and wishes to find all nucleotide measurement data, project, study and sample information.   Researchers in general do not know the specific repositories to search.   The goal is **consistency in results** regardless of search portal.   Search use case example is "orofacial cleft".

**Platform contact:**  Mike Feolo, Allison Heath and Anne Deslattes Mays

**Researcher contact:** Anne Deslattes Mays

**Dataset:** Determined from each search [NCBI SRA Results](), [click through dbGaP results](), [dbGaP search results](), and [Kids First results]()

**What should be returned?:** Search should return **consistent results regardless** of search origin.   Search results should be identical regardless of the search point of entry.

**Which repositor(ies):**  Kids First Data Resource, NCBI SRA, NCBI dbGaP

**Which search portal:**  Kids First Data Resource Portal, NCBI SRA, NCBI dbGaP

**Which compute platform(s):** CAVATICA

**Which workflows/tools/apps/code:** depending upon which dataset is retrieved any appropriate that the user has access to on the CAVATICA platform, or on GitHub, repurposed or developed.
